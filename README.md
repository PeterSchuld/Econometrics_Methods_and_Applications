              This Case Project is the final assignment of our MOOC. It is of an applied nature, 
              and it asks you to answer practical questions by means of econometric methods. 
              By doing the case, you will integrate various econometric methods and skills that were trained in our MOOC.

### Offered by
Erasmus University: a top-100 ranked international research university based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Our academic teaching and research focuses on four areas: health, wealth, culture and governance. 

Erasmus School of Economics welcomes over 7000 Dutch and international students every academic year and provides world class education in economic disciplines and econometrics.

Erasmus School of Economics’ history goes back to 1913, when the Netherlands School of Commerce was founded through a private initiative with broad support from the Rotterdam business community. 

The statutory recognition of higher education in commerce and economics as an academic discipline resulted in 1939 into the Netherlands School of Economics, the predecessor of Erasmus University Rotterdam. 

The university gained worldwide fame with its education and research in the fields of (business-) economics and econometrics and with its renowned professors, such as Johannes Witteveen, who became the first Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Henri Theil, and Jan Tinbergen, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1969. 

The school’s Econometric Institute is internationally recognised for its groundbreaking work and has Jan Tinbergen, one of the pioneers of econometrics as a discipline, as one of its founders.
